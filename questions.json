Check that B Lab accepts your particular accreditation.\n\n2) Living wage benchmark - share the benchmark data and, if applicable, indicate which data subset you have chosen (e.g. individual or family). Where information is publicly available, add a link to the source. Where data was purchased and is not publicly available, send the original data set. Note, WageIndicator and Fair Wage Network have informed B Lab that companies may share datasets for verification purposes. Use colors and notes to highlight which data is relevant for B Lab’s verification. \n\n3) Prevailing wages - share list of workers or roles and their wage components. If the base wage already meets the living wage benchmark, then you only need to provide the base wage. If you add extra wage components, such as benefits and bonuses, then include notes to explain what they are for and how they are earned. All wage data should be disaggregated, meaning all extra wage components should be listed separately. If you include extra wage components beyond the ones mentioned as examples in B Lab's guidance, include notes to justify how the components meet B Lab's principles for inclusion (as described in the Knowledge Base Article about living wage). Please clearly demonstrate in the document the rationale/calculation that justifies the % selected as the answer option.\n\n4) All data should be harmonized, meaning they are based on the same rate (e.g. USD per month) and calculated pro rata (e.g. for those working part-time). Data should also be harmonized across locations, though they should remain in the local currency. The data and calculations you share should clearly show how you came to your answer (e.g. spreadsheet formulas should be visible).\n\nKnowledge Base Article link: https://kb.bimpactassessment.net/en/support/solutions/articles/43000671646-answering-living-wage-questions-in-the-b-impact-assessment#5.-External-resources\n\nReminders\nThe living wage is not the minimum wage. A living wage usually goes beyond the minimum wage required by law and ensures that workers are able to meet a decent standard of living for them and their family.\n\nAccepted living wage benchmarks can be found in the Knowledge Base Article.

In addition, please share a list of employees in the program and the benefits those individuals receive from your company.\n\nMore Details\nTwo sets of documents are required for this question.\n\nFirst, documents to contextualize your workforce development program. These may include a company webpage that describes the initiative, governing documents that explain the origin and goals of these efforts, materials provided to the company’s human resources/hiring staff that explain your company's focus on hiring chronically-underemployed populations and the nature of the program, etc.\n\nSecond, a modified employee roster or spreadsheet with the following information:\n\n1) Employee name or other indicator (Employee 1, 2, etc).\n2) Individual’s barrier to employment.\n3) Employee's hourly pay (If the living wage date used is broken down by month vs. by hour, please calculate your employee's monthly salary instead (i.e. match your employee wage information to the pay period of the living wage data)).\n4) Address of employment.\n5) Living wage data for your area, including a link to the referenced source.\n6) Employment status (i.e. full-time, part-time, temporary). If a temporary employee, please also explain what strategies the company employs to assist these individuals in obtaining a semi-stable income over time.  \n7) Description of training provided to employee. If available, please also upload a orientation agenda or training checklist.\n8) A yes/no column answering the question: “Is the company’s standard benefits package available to the employee?” Please also upload a relevant offer letter or job posting that describes the company’s benefits.\n9) Total number of all employees. \n\nReminders\nThis question is not intended to reward companies for hiring ad hoc individuals with a barrier to employment. There are other questions in the assessment to capture that positive practice. The intent here is to recognize companies who have designed a program to consistently hire and support the chronically-underemployed.    \n\nThe living wage is not the minimum wage. A living wage goes beyond meeting the minimum wage required by law and ensures that employees have the money necessary to meet living expenses in your region. It is a market-based approach that draws upon geographically specific expenditure data related to an individual’s likely minimum food, health insurance, housing, transportation, and other basic necessities (e.g. clothing, personal care items, etc.) costs.\n\nAccepted living wage data can be found at the links below:\n\nCanada: http://livingwagecanada.ca/\nUnited Kingdom: livingwage.org.uk/calculation\nUnited States: livingwage.mit.edu\nSelected other countries: https://www.globallivingwage.org/\n\nYou may redact employee names on any document."

If you do not have this, then provide an overview of your chosen benchmark and the prevailing wage calculations.\n\nMore Details\n1) Accreditation - Evidence of third-party accreditation can be in the form of an email confirmation from the accreditation provider or public mention on the provider’s website. Check that B Lab accepts your particular accreditation.\n\n2) Living wage benchmark - share the benchmark data and, if applicable, indicate which data subset you have chosen (e.g. individual or family). Where information is publicly available, add a link to the source. Where data was purchased and is not publicly available, send the original data set. Note, WageIndicator and Fair Wage Network have informed B Lab that companies may share datasets for verification purposes. Use colors and notes to highlight which data is relevant for B Lab’s verification.\n\n3) Prevailing wages - share list of workers or roles and their wage components. If the base wage already meets the living wage benchmark, then you only need to provide the base wage. If you add extra wage components, such as benefits and bonuses, then include notes to explain what they are for and how they are earned. All wage data should be disaggregated, meaning all extra wage components should be listed separately. If you include extra wage components beyond the ones mentioned as examples in B Lab's guidance, include notes to justify how the components meet B Lab's principles for inclusion (as described in the Knowledge Base Article about living wage). Please clearly demonstrate in the document the rationale/calculation that justifies the % selected as the answer option.\n\n4) All data should be harmonized, meaning they are based on the same rate (e.g. USD per month) and calculated pro rata (e.g. for those working part-time). Data should also be harmonized across locations, though they should remain in the local currency. The data and calculations you share should clearly show how you came to your answer (e.g. spreadsheet formulas should be visible).\n\nKnowledge Base Article link: https://kb.bimpactassessment.net/en/support/solutions/articles/43000671646-answering-living-wage-questions-in-the-b-impact-assessment#5.-External-resources\n\nReminders\nThe living wage is not the minimum wage. A living wage usually goes beyond the minimum wage required by law and ensures that workers are able to meet a decent standard of living for them and their family.\n\nAccepted living wage benchmarks can be found in the Knowledge Base Article. B Lab accepts benchmarks that cover most countries in the world, though the data is not always free.\n\nIf your company answered this question using prevailing wages calculations, you should be able to demonstrate how you followed the principles and steps prescribed in the Knowledge Base Article.\n\nYou may redact employee names on documents.",
